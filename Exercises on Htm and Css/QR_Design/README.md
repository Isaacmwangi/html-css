![QR Code Design Screenshot](images/my_design_screenshot.png)


## Project Structure
- `qrcode.html`: HTML file containing the structure of the webpage.
- `styles.css`: CSS file for styling the webpage elements.

## Html
In my html, I have structured my code in the following manner
- The HTML file (`qrcode.html`) includes a `<div>` container with two nested `<div>` elements:
  - One `<div>` for displaying a QR code image.
  - Another `<div>` for displaying text content (h1 and h2 headings).

## Styling
In CSS file (`styles.css`) I did the following styling:

- `body`: Set a light background color and centers the content.
- `.container`: Styled the main container with a white background, border radius, and centered alignment.
- `img`: Added padding and border radius to the QR code image to look similar with what was in our given test.
- `.text`: Styled the text content with centered alignment and padding.
- `h1 p` and `h2`: Sets font styles, weights, and colors for the headings and paragraphs.
